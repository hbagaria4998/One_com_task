Problem assignment - You are the owner of a restaurant, and want your customers to be able to order food in advance from their homes, so it'll be ready when they arrive at your restaurant. Write a Django application that supports this.
Think about and develop models for a Product and Order; you do not have to model the customers
Ensure authentication works for the shop owner, but authentication does not need to work for customers
The shop owner must be able to add products through the Django Admin
Your application should offer a simple frontend, where customers can view products and create and order using a Django form
